## The Homer Multitext

*The Homer Multitext*, Casey Dué and Mary Ebbott, Editors. 

<http://www.homermultitext.org>

A challenging problem in integrating diverse humanist data.

Conversations beginning c. 1999. Production of data since 2007. 200+ editors contributing.

---

## CITE

**C**ollections, **I**ndices, **T**exts, & **E**xtensions.

The basis for the *Homer Multitext* and some other projects.

---

Machine-actionable canonical citation with URNs.

URNs capturing the semantics of specific models of scholarly data.

(*n.b.* URNs are the *immutable* version of the URI standard.)

---

Both the CTS URN and the CITE2 URN are under expert review as proposed standards for the IETF.

---

## Scholarly Primitives

- Passages of Text 
- Everything Else

---

## Texts: The OHCO2 Model

"An ordered hierarchy of citation objects"

Cited with a `CtsUrn`, which captures the semantics of the model:

~~~ bash
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.msA:1.1#Μῆνιν ἄειδε θεὰ Πηληϊάδεω  Ἀχιλῆος  
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.msA:1.2#οὐλομένην· ἡ μυρί' Ἀχαιοῖς ἄλγε' ἔθηκεν·
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.msA:1.3#πολλὰς δ' ἰφθίμους ψυχὰς Ἄϊδι προΐαψεν
~~~

## Citable Objects (Everything Else)

Citable objects are unique objects in versioned collections, which may or may not have intrinsic order.

Cited with a `Cite2Urn`, which captures the semantics of the model.

Distinct objects may have identical contents, but within in a collection, each object is uniquely identified.

---

A collection may be referred to either in the abstract as a **notional** collection, or concretely as a **specific** version of a notional collection. 

---

**Notional collection:** "Folios of the Venetus A manuscript"

A notional collection consists merely of uniquely identified objects.

`urn:cite2:hmt:msA:12r` ➛ An object in a notional collection

---

**Concrete collection:** "The Homer Multitext collection of folios of the Venetus A manuscript, version 1" 

In a concrete collection, each objects is, itself, a collection of **citable, typed property values**.

`urn:cite2:hmt:msA.v1:12r` ➛ An object in a versioned collection

`urn:cite2:hmt:msA.v1.label:12r` ➛ A *citable property value* of an object in a versioned collection

---

The CITE Architecture seeks to bring to a computational environment the same flexibility regarding *identity* that scholars have always enjoyed.

---

## The “I” in “CITE”

**Indices** can be **s-v-o** relations among URNs, with the verb expressed as a CITE2 URN as well.

Or, CITE Objects can have properties of type `CtsUrn` or `Cite2Urn`.

---

**Scholarly Primitives & Compositions Thereof**

---

## CITE and CEX

The CITE Exchange format.

A plain-text, self-documenting, serialization of an integrated digital library.

---

---

## Fail-Safe

No matter what, a CEX file should provide access to uniquely identified pieces of data—texts or objects—and establish relations among them.

**Extensions** are merely *other* uniquely identified pieces of data, in *other* **relations** to citable data.

A service or app can implement these in fancy ways, or not, but the integrity of the library should remain intact.

---

## Example 1 of 2

Citing and resolving images

---

The old practice: Citation to a *place where an image can be found.*

- A page in a book
- An address on the internet

---

We prefer to preserve the *scholarly identity* of an image, recognizinig tha the “same” image might exist in different locations, in different transformations.

---

A collection of images is like any other collection in CITE.

---

The `citeimage` datamodel has only three propertie:

- URN
- Caption
- Rights

---


## The `citebinaryimage` datamodel

- a collection implementing `citeimage`
- a citable collection of binary image implementations:
	- Property: protocol (jpeg-in-filesystem, IIIF, IIPImage API, DeepZoom, &c.)
	- Server URL
	- Path to images on server
- attach the two

---

The effect…

- scholarly identity of an image is preserved
- we can deliver binary image data however is convenient

---

## Example 2 of 2

Extended String Type Properties

---

There are many specific kinds of well-known text, including "Well-Known Text":

- GeoJSON
- URIs
- Latitude/Longitude
- Markdown
- TEI XML
