## The Homer Multitext

*The Homer Multitext*, Casey Dué and Mary Ebbott, Editors. 

<http://www.homermultitext.org>

A challenging problem in integrating diverse humanist data.

Conversations beginning c. 1999. Production of data since 2007. 200+ editors contributing.

---

## CITE

**C**ollections, **I**ndices, **T**exts, & **E**xtensions.

The basis for the *Homer Multitext* and some other projects.

---

Machine-actionable canonical citation with URNs.

URNs capturing the semantics of specific models of scholarly data.

(*n.b.* URNs are the *immutable* version of the URI standard.)

---

Both the CTS URN and the CITE2 URN are under expert review as proposed standards for the IETF.

---

## Scholarly Primitives

- Passages of Text 
- Everything Else

---

## Texts: The OHCO2 Model

"An ordered hierarchy of citation objects"

Cited with a <code style="color:navy;">CtsUrn</code>, which captures the semantics of the model:

~~~ bash
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.msA:1.1#Μῆνιν ἄειδε θεὰ Πηληϊάδεω  Ἀχιλῆος  
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.msA:1.2#οὐλομένην· ἡ μυρί' Ἀχαιοῖς ἄλγε' ἔθηκεν·
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.msA:1.3#πολλὰς δ' ἰφθίμους ψυχὰς Ἄϊδι προΐαψεν
~~~

---

## Citable Objects (Everything Else)

Citable objects are unique objects in versioned collections, which may or may not have intrinsic order.

Cited with a <code style="color:navy;">Cite2Urn</code>, which captures the semantics of the model.

Distinct objects may have identical contents, but within in a collection, each object is uniquely identified.

---

A collection may be referred to either in the abstract as a **notional** collection, or concretely as a **specific version** of a notional collection. 

---

**Notional collection:** "Folios of the Venetus A manuscript"

A notional collection consists merely of uniquely identified objects.

<code style="color:navy;">urn:cite2:hmt:msA:12r</code> ➛ An object in a notional collection

---

**Concrete collection:** "The Homer Multitext collection of folios of the Venetus A manuscript, version 1" 

In a concrete collection, each objects is, itself, a collection of **citable, typed property values**.

<code style="color:navy;">urn:cite2:hmt:msA.v1:12r</code> ➛ An object in a versioned collection

<code style="color:navy;">urn:cite2:hmt:msA.v1.label:12r</code> ➛ A *citable property value* of an object in a versioned collection

---

The CITE Architecture seeks to bring to a computational environment the same flexibility regarding *identity* that scholars have always enjoyed.

---

## The “I” in “CITE”

**Indices** can be **s-v-o** relations among URNs, with the verb expressed as a CITE2 URN as well.

Or, CITE Objects can have properties of type <code style="color:navy;">CtsUrn</code> or <code style="color:navy;">Cite2Urn</code>.

---

So…

**Scholarly Primitives & Compositions Thereof**

---

## CITE and CEX

The CITE Exchange format.

A plain-text, self-documenting, serialization of an integrated digital library.

---

<img src="images/voyager.jpg"/>

---

## Fail-Safe

A CEX file provides access to pieces of data—texts or objects, and establish relations among them, uniquely identified with machine-actionable URNs.

**Extensions** are merely *other* uniquely identified pieces of data, in *other* **relations** to citable data.

A service or app can ignore these and continue to deliver useful, itegrated data. Or it can implement them in fancy ways.

---

## Example 1 of 2

Citing and resolving images

---

The old practice: Citation to a *place where an image can be found.*

- A page in a book
- An address on the internet

---

We prefer to preserve the *scholarly identity* of an image, recognizing that the “same” image might exist in different locations, in different transformations.

---

A collection of images is like any other collection in CITE.

---

The <code style="color:navy;">imagemodel</code> datamodel has only three properties:

- URN
- Caption
- Rights

---


## citebinaryimage

For the <code style="color:navy;">binaryimg</code> datamodel:

There is a collection implementing <code style="color:navy;">binaryimg</code>.

Each object in it must have four properties:

- The protocol (jpeg-in-filesystem, IIIF, IIPImage API, DeepZoom, &c.)
- A service URL
- A path to images on a server
- The image collection to which it applies

---

The effect…

- scholarly identity of an image is preserved
- we can deliver binary image data however is convenient…
- including in more than one way for the same collection of images

---

## Example 2 of 2

Extended String Type Properties

---

There are many specific kinds of well-known text, including "Well-Known Text":

- GeoJSON
- URIs
- Latitude/Longitude
- Markdown
- TEI XML

---

Build this presentation with:

~~~ bash
pandoc -t revealjs dh2019.md -s -o dh2019.html --metadata pagetitle=presentation -V theme=solarized`
~~~

The result will be `dh2019.html`.

## Why CEX instead of TEI?

One answer among many:

- It is a truth universally acknowledged that *aggregation* is always easier than *disaggregation*.
- TEI’s fundamental assumption runs counter to this truth.

---

## Why CEX instead of RDF?

Been there; done that:

- We have expressed the entirety of the *HMT* in a single `.ttl` file of RDF triples, and served it via Fuseki, with end-user applications. It worked.
- The file was 10x as large as our current CEX (even with less data).
- It took five triples to express what a two-field CEX line (URN + text) in sequence can express.
